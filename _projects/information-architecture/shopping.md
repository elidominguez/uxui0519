A local retail chain has decided to expand into e-commerce. Help organize their products and adapt their in-store experience and brand for the web.

Bear in mind that the retail store you are assigned to may already have an e-commerce platform, but we'd like you to focus on designing your own platform without taking the current one into account.


Setup
-----

- Teams of 3-4
- 3 class days


Materials
---------

- Sketch
- Invision
- Google Slides or Keynote Presentation


Target Device
-------------

- Desktop website (responsiveness is a plus)


Requirements
------------

- In-person visit to the local retail store in order to get a feel for the needs and behaviors of users
- Mid-fidelity click-through prototype (focus is on information architecture and user flow)  
- User flow for discovery of a product
- User flow for the checkout and purchase process
- Clear hierarchy and organization of product content
- Evaluate your design against heuristics and CRAP principles
- Provide evidence for key decisions through research and testing


Nice to Have
--------

- Responsiveness
- Hi-fidelity screens


Presentation <small>(6 minutes)</small>
---------------------------

Your will have 6 minutes to summarize your work. We should get a strong sense of:

- The problem and the user(s)
- Findings from research and how these informed your design
- Your design, including a prototype
- Next steps and learnings


Tips
