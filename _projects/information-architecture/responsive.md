title: Responsive Redesign
assigned: Sept 13, 2018
due: Sept 18, 2018

Over the next 3 days, you’ll be redesigning a website for a local business. Keep in mind that this is a speculative redesign for practice, so you won’t have access to the client or stakeholders. 

Keep in mind that the website you’re redesigning already has content. You’ll want to inventory and audit that content to determine:
- how the content should be organized
- what content to keep, cut, or edit
- how users can navigate the site
- what’s the most important content for users

## Setup

- Group Project
- Groups of 2-3 people 
- 3 class days <small>(plus the weekend!)</small>

## Materials 

- Sketch 
- Invision
- Principle 

## Project Scope 

Remember that this is a responsive redesign which means that your users will be able to access this website through all devices. Your design should be robust and flexible to accommodate this variety. It’s your job as a designer to offer a good experience to your user, not their job to bring the right device to your experience. 

## Deliverables 

- High fidelity re-design of the website for **two** devices (Mobile or Web). 
- Working prototype
- Presentation of iterations and final proposal.

## Suggestions
- Since you will not have access to stakeholders. We recommend to deconstruct the website with your group and break down the content of the website. Try to come up with different versions of the website in order to do some user testing and see what is working and what can be improved. 

## Presentation (6 minutes)

Your presentation should answer the following questions:

1. What variations on your design did your group explore?
2. How does your design is improving the existing site being re-designed?
3. What would you do differently next time?

## Extra Mile

Animation's in your re-design's.
