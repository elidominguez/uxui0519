This project is the culmination of all the work we've been doing in class regarding HTML and CSS. 
We'be been working on the structure for your portfolio so now is time to bring it to life.
You'll need to finalize your portfolio with one blog post. The content of this post will be the design report from your last project.

Getting started

- Sketch how you want to organize the content of your webpage
- Create a css file and link it on index.html
- Choose a layout system (Flexbox or Grid)
- Style the page according to your plans
- Make sure to have at least one media query

**Remember:** We'll review the work and clear any doubts the following day.

Road Map
