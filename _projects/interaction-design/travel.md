Apple has decided to launch an app called Travel. Following their Human Interface Guidelines, develop the concept and UI of a few key screens to get buy-in for further work.

## Setup

- Work in a pair
- 2 days

## Materials

- Sketch
- The HIG
- iOS Sketch template
- Sketch
- Invision
- Principle

## Deliverables

- High Fidelity mockups of 4–6 screens
- Presentation of iterations and final proposal.

## Suggestions

- You’ll have to make some quick assumptions in order to get started on this project. Acknowledge the assumptions by creating a proto-persona.
- Make several variations on your design before deciding on a direction. Ask for feedback and input from your colleagues!
- Be careful not to rely too much on symbols while exploring design concepts. When you get closer to a confident final design, start cleaning up your document with a system of symbols and well-named layer groups.

## Presentation (6 minutes)

Your presentation should answer the following questions:

1. What variations on your design did you explore?
2. How does your design reflect the guidance in the HIG?
3. What would you do differently next time?

## Extra Mile

If you have time, string together some of your screens into a working prototype. Make it even more realistic by adding some animations!
