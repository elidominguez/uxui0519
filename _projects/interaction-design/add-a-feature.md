title: Add a Feature
assigned: Sept 7, 2018
due: Sept 12, 2018
---

You will be developing a new feature for an existing app based on an area of functionality to explore. Your work will culminate in a high-fidelity prototype that reflects your best path forward based on research, iteration, and testing. For apps that have both Android and iOS implementations, you may choose either platform.


Setup
-----

- Individual Project
- 4 class days <small>(plus the weekend!)</small>


Materials
---------

- Sketch
- Invision
- Principle <small>(or Flinto)</small>
- Google Docs
- Google Slides


Background
----------

As a new designer joining a team, you’ll often have to rapidly come up to speed on your product, your users, and quickly iterate on solutions under tight timelines. Your other stakeholders will all have opinions and you’ll have to get into the practice of supporting your claims.


Aspects to Consider
-------------------
- Who are the users? What are the user goals? How does the assigned scenario fit into their day? How can you quickly learn about them?
- What are the user’s tasks? What’s the hypothesis about how the new functionality will change their behaviors?
- How should the new functionality tie into the navigation of the product? You are expected to try variations.
- You must be able to defend your design decisions. How will you test and gather evidence to support your work?

Target Device
-------------

- Mobile App (Either iOS or Android)


Requirements
------------

- User flows for the key new tasks the user needs complete
- Show how the feature fits into the app navigation
- Evaluate your design against heuristics and CRAP principles
- Digitized screens at high fidelity
- Provide evidence for key decisions through research and testing


Timeline
--------

- Submit Project Plan <small>by Fri. 7 Sept. @ 4pm</small>
- Deliver 3-minute mid-point presentation <small>Mon. 10 Sept. @ 4pm</small>
- End-Of-Project Presentations will start <small>Wed. 12 Sept. @ 10am</small>
- Submit a final report of your project <small>by Wed. 12 Sept. @ 6pm</small>


End-of-Project Presentation <small>(6 minutes)</small>
---------------------------

Your will have 6 minutes to summarize your work. We should get a strong sense of:

- The problem and the user(s)
- Findings from research and how these informed your design
- Your design, including a prototype
- Next steps


Report <small>due Wed. 12 Sept. @ 6pm</small>
------

Your report will gather all of your work from this project into a single PDF. You should also include a self-assessment based on how you think this project went.


Design Thinking
---------------

Remember that design challenges are tackled by alternating divergent and convergent thinking modes. You are expected to conduct exploratory research and narrow down the scope of the problem. Then generate multiple possible solutions. Evaluate. Test. Repeat. You’ll have the opportunity to show these iterations in the report.


Tips
----

- Devise a plan of attack
- Timebox your work
- Get feedback early & often
- Iterate
- Perfect is the enemy of good
- Build out your presentation deck and your report as you go
- Work fast; have fun
