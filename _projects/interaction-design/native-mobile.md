You will be designing a new app to be launched on both Android and iOS. For the sake of this exercise, assume that both apps will be built out by developers specializing in the respective platforms, and that they will be built natively. It's you're job to:

- quickly prototype a key flow of the app
- develop a visual identity to accompany it
- translate both into expressions appropriate to each platform
