title: Sketch Practice - Responsive Website Part 2
assigned: 21
due: 23
---

Go back to the website you used for the 'Responsive Website Part 1' homework. The aim of this second part is to understand design systems and style tiles. 

 **Upload your final Sketch files** [to the Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1VmlYsB8FlHS2gRhqbrUd9HXiF5dVHqfA) in the "Completed Work" folder.


Deliverable: 
-----------------------------------------

It is **HIGHLY** recommended that you use symbols for this exercise, so that you don't spend infinite amount of time on it. 


**Deliverable Instructions**
1. Looking at the website and at examples of design systems, reverse engineer the style tile that has been used to create this website
2. More advanced (opcional): Use nested symbols to make the beginning of a design system for the site
3. Upload your Sketch file [to the Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1VmlYsB8FlHS2gRhqbrUd9HXiF5dVHqfA) in the "Completed Work" folder.
