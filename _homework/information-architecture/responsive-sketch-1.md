Now that you are experts in Sketch, we want to push it one step further and understand the use of symbols in the context of a responsive website. This first part of the exercise is aimed at improving your sense of responsive and how can a design be adapted to different viewport sizes.  

 **Upload your final Sketch files** [to the Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/10s9AqfUuKA-Efffn39t1f5mn6FufJjF1) in the "Completed Work" folder.


Deliverable: 
-----------------------------------------

It is **HIGHLY** recommended that you use symbols for this exercise, so that you don't spend infinite amount of time on it. 


**Deliverable Instructions**
1. Choose a responsive website
2. Choose three viewport sizes (Mobile / Tablet / Desktop)
3. Recreate two screens in these three sizes. Try to replicate with screens side by side (not tracing!)
4. Upload your Sketch file [to the Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/10s9AqfUuKA-Efffn39t1f5mn6FufJjF1) in the "Completed Work" folder.
