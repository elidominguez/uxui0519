If you haven't already
----------------------

1. Download and install [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com)
2. Set up the [Craft plugin](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft)

Plugins suggested
- Sketch Runner helps you to get around Sketch quicker by giving you an intuitive interface to supercharge your daily workflow. Stop searching through your menu & start running commands directly from your keyboard. [Sketch Runner](https://sketchrunner.com/)

- This plugin enables you to export both HTML & CSS files directly out of Sketch. It is a valauble paid plugin that can help you stay one step ahead and, you can study your designs in depth from an engineering perspective. [Anima Toolkit - Sketch to HTML](https://launchpad.animaapp.com/)

- Launchpad; a Sketch Plugin that integrates seamlessly into Sketch and enables defining and viewing different iPhone/iPad sizes including Portrait/Landscape. [Launchpad For Sketch](https://animaapp.github.io/)

- Sort me will help you get organized. As you create new layers in rapid successions by using Make Grid or other duplication techniques, your Sketch document will become messy.
Remember to hit "download Zip" from github not clone :)

- Magic Mirror. Presentation has always played a big part in all designer's workflows. Like a nice icon, it shows the care that went into the app. It gives people a story before they jump in. Apple is famous for presenting beautiful photography and mockups in 3D. Most times we rely on Photoshop to do that sort of image editing, but with Magic Mirror, you can achieve the same results in Sketch. [Magic Mirror](http://magicsketch.io/mirror/?src=old)
