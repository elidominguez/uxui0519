Exercise to hand in before Tuesday 28th
------------------

In order to continue leveling up your Sketch skills, we are going to kick off with a simple tracing exercise. Intructions below:

1. Watch the above video tutorials. 
2. Download the images located [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1zqIDUMYJ9Om5BRzHFvFFZ_BPeCiEFpOV) in the "Images to Trace" folder.
3. Create a new artboard the size of the image.
4. Decrease the opacity of the image
5. Lock the image layer (hold down the Option key and hover over the layer and a padlock icon will appear instead of the hide icon)
6. Use the background image as your guide to recreate the screen.
7. Find a font that is as similar as possible and adjust the size and spacing as needed. (You likely won't find the exact font, so don't worry!)
8. Keep an eye on the details! Watch out for gradients, drop shadows, icon size and weight, etc. 
9. Have fun!
10. UPLOAD your final Sketch files [HERE] (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1G_-aPVu9x5xdNUEJDG_tHRnsb2ym300Y) in the "Completed Work" folder.
