Share your ideas!
------------------

- Your next individual project (Add a feature) will start at the end of the week. The goal of this project is to add a new feature to an existing app. 
- In order to be ready for it, we would like you to prepare two to three ideas of a new feature that could be added to an existing app. 
- All the ideas will be mixed and the topic of your project will be based on one of your peers' idea!
