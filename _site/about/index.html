<h1>About the Course</h1>

<p>In this class, we will be exploring the three primary languages that make up the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, we will be making use of a popular JavaScript library called jQuery.</p>

<h2>Attendance</h2>

<p>Classes will meet on Mondays and Wednesdays from 6:30-9:30. Attendance is required and will be taken each time we meet. There is a lot of material to work through, and we will frequently work in pairs or small groups. If you miss class, it will be easy to fall behind, and it will also be a disservice to your classmates.</p>

<h2>Homework</h2>

<p>Homework will invariably be assigned each week. It is our goal in the class that the homework cause as little stress as possible, and that it reflect working through practical examples. Assignments will be posted on Schoology for this course, which is also where it will be submitted for feedback. We will strive to give you meaningful feedback on your assignments within two days.</p>

<p>Homework is required as well, but there is no penalty for turning in incomplete or imperfect work. On the contrary, the homework is a chance to practice and extend what we are working on in class, and will be of most benefit if approached with an uncritical mindset.</p>

<h2>Office Hours</h2>

<p>Patrick and Sebastian will have scheduled office hours, and it is expected that you will meet with one of them for a half hour every other week.</p>

<p>Office hours will generally be held over Google Hangout or Skype. If needed, arrangements can be made to meet in person at the GA campus.</p>

<p>More information is forthcoming regarding scheduling.</p>

<h2>Final Projects</h2>

<p>At the end of the course, every student in the class will be presenting a final project. We recommend starting work on the concept for the project early in the class, to give time to develop it as your skills advance. We will be discussing these in more detail both in class and during office hours.</p>
